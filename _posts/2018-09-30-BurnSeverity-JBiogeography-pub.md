[**A special thanks to the NASA Landsat Program for featuring our work on their Science Blog**](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/article/looking-at-burn-severity-and-post-fire-forest-regeneration-in-chiles-andean-cordillera-home-to-the-monkey-puzzle-tree/)

In our new paper, published in the [Journal of Biogeography](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.13428), we investigate postfire regeneration patterns of Araucaria‐Nothofagus forests on the west slope of the Andes Mountains in the Araucanía region of Chile. Specifically, we: a) used satellite data and ground measurements to evaluate the relationship between remotely sensed burn severity and forest mortality; and b) assessed controls of burn severity on forest regeneration at local spatio‐temporal scales. The paper is a product of a collaboration with Colorado State University ([Jason Sibold](http://www.biogeography.colostate.edu/)) and the and Universidad Austral de Chile ([Mauro González](http://www.forestal.uach.cl/instituto/conservacion-biodiversidad-territorio/academicos/mauro-gonzalez.php)).

We think this work is noteworthy because 1) to our knowledge this is the first study that connects field-measured data with satellite-derived burn severity in this corner of the world; 2) one of the primary species of study, *Araucaria araucana* (known commonly as monkey puzzle tree), is recognized as an endangered species on the [International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/) and faces a plethora of threats; and 3) the framework relies on open data, namely Landsat satellite imagery, and could be applied to long-term monitoring or assessment of similar ecosystems. I would go a step further and argue the availability of Landsat data was the primary reason we were able to get this project off the ground.
