I was talking with a couple of colleagues recently and the topic of
reference managers came up. I was shocked to learn there are some folks
out there who do not use one. In an effort to make sure our graduate
students do not grow up like that (no offense to said colleagues), I
gave a brief lecture and demonstration to early graduate students in a
research seminar. If you want to use my slides to convince others to use
a reference manager you can download them from figshare:
