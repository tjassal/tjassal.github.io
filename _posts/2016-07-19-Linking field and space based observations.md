I was invited to speak about some of our [Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI)](https://www.wlci.gov/) research at ‘Aspen Days’* last week in Lander, Wyoming. The event brought together natural resource managers and scientists to discuss aspen research, local aspen management projects and the collaborative partnerships needed to sustain aspen ecosystems.

It was a great opportunity for me to communicate my research directly with natural resource managers. However, more importantly it was a chance to spend time in the field with people that really know these systems and begin to understand their needs and how our science might be able to help answer those questions. It was also a chance to get out of my comfort zone and interact with people that don’t spend all of their time thinking about spatial ecology.

A key component of the research is our ability to connect what we see on the ground with what we see from the sky via satellite imagery. I had a chance to demonstrate the use of the hemispherical (or fish-eye) imaging system in the field and thought I might expand on the process we used to link ground measurements and space based measurements. There are a number of ways to do this, but I”ll present our method here. In a recent study, (Assal et al. 2016) we measured forest canopy condition on the ground via a network of fish-eye photographs designed to measure the amount of leaves, branches and stems in the forest canopy. This metric is known as plant area index (Pfeifer et al., 2012) which can be derived from the fish-eye photos via a gap-fraction inversion procedure (Campbell and Norman, 1989) which measures the amount of radiation transmission through the canopy (Martens et al., 1993).

We used Landsat imagery (30 meter spatial resolution; about the size of a baseball infield) that was collected from a satellite at the same time as our field campaign. To adequately sample the forest canopy, we established a grid of nine photo points in a sample plot, coincident with a Landsat pixel.

Each hemispheric photo location is spaced approximately 10m from the nearest photo point. The field of view of each hemispheric photo is shown (red circle) with an approximate radius of 3.5 m. Center: examples of fish-eye photos collected from two field sites. Right: classified photos indicating plant material in green. </center>
<br>

The information from each plot was used to identify a linear relationship between the amount of plant material on the ground and the amount of plant material measured from the satellite (the Normalized Difference Moisture Index was used as a proxy for amount of plant material). Each point in the figure below represents the information obtained from the nine fish-eye photos taken at each sampling location (figure, above left).
