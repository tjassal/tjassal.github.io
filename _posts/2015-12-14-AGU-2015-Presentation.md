I will present my research on the effects of drought on deciduous and coniferous forest communities along the shrubland ecotone at the AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA. My poster presentation is part of the session entitled: (B53F) Remote Sensing to Support Investigations in Plant-Climate Interactions  on Friday afternoon, December 18, in Moscone South.
