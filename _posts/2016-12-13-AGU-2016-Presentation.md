I will present research on drought-induced variability of sagebrushecosystem productivity in the Upper Green River Basin at the AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA at 10:35 am in Moscone West Rm 2008. My talk is part of the session entitled: *(B32C) Remote Sensing to Support Investigations in Plant-Climate Interactions.*
