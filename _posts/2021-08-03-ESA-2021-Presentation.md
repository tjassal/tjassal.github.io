Tim will present research on long-term monitoring of riparian areas over broad scales at the [2021 Ecological Society of America Meeting]( https://www.esa.org/longbeach/). If you’re ‘at’ the conference check out my talk - [‘Connecting stakeholders across scales: monitoring long-term upland and riparian vegetation trends to inform habitat management in a mountainous environment’]( https://t.co/jwgMcvOTKI?amp=1) - at 12 pm PDT. More information and a link to a recent publication on this work is available [here](https://assallab.org/blog/riparianmonitoring-ecologicalindicators-pub).
