We’re happy to report that our very own Research Assistant, Hana Matsumoto, has won the prestigious [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) for her proposal "Monitoring epigenetic changes from leaf to landscape: a case study using remote sensing."

Two other lab alumni have also earned recognition from NSF. Nick Manning was hugely instrumental in the labs early development while he worked here from 2020-21. He earned honorable mention for his proposal this year. Nikki Di Domenico, a long-time friend of the lab who worked in the field with us last summer, won the fellowship in 2021. Nick and Nikki were Tim's first two undergraduate students (in a grad course) at Kent State.  

We here in the lab are beaming with pride from Hana, Nick and Nikki's accomplishments. Keep an eye out for them – they are all on their way to big things!
