Tim will discuss tracking the fate of expired Conservation Reserve Program fields in the United States at the [American Association of Geographers Annual Meeting](https://aag-annualmeeting.secure-platform.com/a/organizations/main/home). The group has developed remote sensing time series models which are used to predict the status of expired CRP fields. These predictions are then used to calculated the rate of durability in CRP fields in an effort to understand legacy benefits after the contract has expired. His [talk](https://aag-annualmeeting.secure-platform.com/a/solicitations/19/sessiongallery/3776/application/13510), entitled 'Predicting the durability of expired fields in the Conservation Reserve Program: Can we measure enduring benefits of the program from afar?' is in the session: 'Understanding the adaptive capacity of social ecological systems to address regional-scale environmental change in the American West' on Saturday afternoon at 3:40 pm EDT.
