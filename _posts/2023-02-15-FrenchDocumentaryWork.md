Part of this project was featured in the French documentary *When Oceans Threaten Cities*. The group filmed Jen and Tim's work, as one of four sites they are featuring around the world. The documentary aired on France5 and brings attention to global sea level rise. The trailer can be viewed [here](https://www.c21media.net/screenings/terranoa/when-oceans-threaten-cities/19653/).

Many thanks to Laurence Thiriat, the director who featured our work. It was an interesting experience and we certainly have a lot more respect for actor's craft!
