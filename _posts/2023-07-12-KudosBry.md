A big congratulations to Bryanna Norlin who successfully defended her thesis research on modelling the potential niche of Atlantic White Cedar throughout southern New Jersey. Bry is now a two time first generation graduate (right one Bry!!!) and we wish her all the best in the the next step of her career!
