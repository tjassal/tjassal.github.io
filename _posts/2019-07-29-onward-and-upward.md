I’m happy to announce that I will be joining the faculty at [Kent State University](https://www.kent.edu/) this fall!

I have accepted a tenure-track position in Environmental Remote Sensing in the [Department of Geography](https://www.kent.edu/geography). I am very excited to join a dynamic group of faculty that supports the kind of research I do.  I will be building a lab that specializes in Landscape Dynamics Research and recruiting undergraduate technicians, master and doctoral graduate students,  post-doc scientists and undergraduate technicians soon. Stay tuned for details.

Alas, this means I have left the US Geological Survey after 12 years. I appreciate the opportunities afforded to me while I was there and all the ways my career grew. Unfortunately,  the USGS, like nearly all federal agencies these days, has seen massive budget cuts which has reduced the capacity to do science for our country.

I will miss many colleagues and collaborators and working at the interface of science and natural resource management. I am extremely proud of how we connected our work to those on the front lines of natural resource management. However the heart of my work – **distilling enormous amounts of satellite data to answer ecological questions** – will continue and be the central focus of my new lab.

Note, my old contact (assalt@usgs.gov) is no longer active. My new contact information:
