Yes the lab is winding down, but we're still finishing up research projects. Three of the lab members gave presentations at this year's [ESA annual meeting](https://www.esa.org/longbeach2024/). 

**Steph** presented her master's research on Mountain Lion habitat selection after the Woolsey Fire in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area in southern California. 

**Hannah** presented her master's research on Estimating deciduous fractional shrub cover in a semi-arid landscape to assess post-fire interannual vegetation change in northern New Mexico. 

It was Steph and Hannah's first major conference presentations. They spoke in front of big crowds and they crushed it!

**Tim** discussed a look back on Hurricane Sandy: measuring the storms effect on a salt water intolerant species at the forest-marsh ecotone.
