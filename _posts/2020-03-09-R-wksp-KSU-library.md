The folks at [Kent State University Libraries](https://www.library.kent.edu/) asked me to give an [Introduction to R course](https://training.kent.edu/coursedetail.php?courseid=1208) as part of their [Technology Workshop series](https://www.kent.edu/it/technology-workshops). I’m told the workshop is at capacity, but if you’d like to follow along today (or at a later date) you can access the lesson plan [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /images/blog/Introduction-to-R.html %}). All of the materials are available on [github](https://github.com/tjassal/Rworkshop) if you’d like to use them – many thanks to all those that have allowed me to borrow and adapt material. If you’re a KSU Student and interested to learn more, check out my *Environmental Data Analysis in R* (GEOG 41195/51195/71195) course offered in the Fall semester.

The course is very brief (75 minutes) with modest goals:

+ Gain exposure with R & RStudio
+ Learn how to import data, do something with it, then export it
+ Create a basic blueprint for analysis of your own data

Course Outline
1. Overview of R & RStudio (20 mins)
2. Packages in R (10 mins)
3. Import Data (15 mins)
4. Visualize Data (15 mins)
5. Moving Beyond Today (10 mins)
