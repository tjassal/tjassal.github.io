The coronavirus has gripped the world the last few weeks. Many things are uncertain, anxiety is running high and academia has transitioned to remote course offerings. We as a society owe a huge debt of gratitude to our first responders, healthcare workers, scientists, researchers, food producers, restaurateurs, grocery clerks ….. and all of those I forgot.

There have been a number of social media clips depicting the reduction in emissions due to the slowdown of the global economy using satellite data. Notably from NASA’s Earth Observatory:

### OLD

I recently contributed a chapter entitled *“Quaking Aspen: The Iconic and Dynamic Deciduous Tree of the Rocky Mountains”* to an AAG special volume . The goal of the essay was to describe aspen’s dynamic nature, challenges associated with stewardship, and current management-science efforts in the West to a broad audience. The open access volume, [Denver and the Rocky Mountain West](http://www.aag.org/cs/publications/special/the_rocky_mountain_west), is a compendium of short essays on topics of geographic interest about the region as opposed to traditional research articles. The book was published by the [American Association of Geographers](http://www.aag.org/) to commemorate the host region of the 2020 meeting. Unfortunately the conference was cancelled due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Rumor has it the meeting might return to Denver in 2023.
