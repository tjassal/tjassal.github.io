The new academic year brought some change to the lab. Mainul headed west to begin a PhD at the University of Iowa and Nick headed north to begin a PhD at Michigan State University. Both helped to form the foundation of the lab with respect to how we work (e.g. workflows, lab protocols, etc.), especially during challenging times. Mainul was the first graduate student in the lab and Nick was the first research assistant! We’ll miss them dearly, but we’re so proud of what they’ve accomplished so far, and excited for all the great things they are going to do out yonder.

We’re excited to welcome Bryanna and Sarah to the lab to begin their graduate study. They both made an immediate mark on the décor of the lab (there were sparse decorations during the pandemic) and are excited to dive into research!
