A new academic year brought new faces to the lab, which also meant it was time to say goodbye to some old friends. We're so excited by what people have accomplished during their time in our lab and excited to see all the good things to come out yonder!

Hana Matsumoto finished up an excellent two year stint in the lab as a research assistant and headed west to the University of Oregon where she'll be working on a Master's Degree in Environmental Studies as a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow!

Jeremy Salvo worked in the lab as undergraduate student and did excellent work preparing and dating dendrochronology samples for our NJ Ghost Forest project. He is now working on a master's degree at the Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute!

We’re excited to welcome two new graduate students into the lab, Stephanie and Hannah!

Stephanie is interested in using GIS and spatial analysis to aid in wildlife conservation. She holds a bachelor’s degree in Environmental and Conservation Biology with a minor in GIS from Kent State. She worked at various national parks before returning for her master’s. 

Hannah is interested in climate change and its effects on various ecosystems and how we manage natural resources. She enjoys GIS and remote sensing and learning how they apply to the study of environmental change and conservation efforts. Hannah holds a bachelor’s degree in Conservation Biology from Kent State University.

We are also excited to welcome three new undergraduate students to the lab - Grace Michael (Geology major), Nae Gizzo (Biology major) and Ana Murray (Geography major) - to help out with dendrochronlogy and other geospatial tasks!
