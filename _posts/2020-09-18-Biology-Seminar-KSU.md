On Friday 9/18, Tim will give a talk entitled “The legacies of fire in forest ecosystems: initiating change from local to landscape scales” as part of the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://www.kent.edu/biology) Fall Seminar series at Kent State University.

**Abstract**  
Wildfire is a natural disturbance process that governs the composition and structure of many forest ecosystems and recovery takes place over time along well-understood successional trajectories. Forest response is governed by life-history traits and materials legacies, which in resilient systems will enable recovery to a predisturbance state. However, disturbance regimes are in a phase of rapid change which has introduced uncertainty into these trajectories. Where resilience processes have been overwhelmed, one potential outcome is forest conversion. I will discuss two case studies (Jemez Mountains, New Mexico and Tolhuaca National Park, Chile) that illustrate the utility of remote sensing toward our understanding of the ecological legacies of fire.
