Today the Department of Geography at Kent State University welcomes
Mogadore High School. Mr. Jerry Vydra, a KSU alumnus, brought his
Environmental Science class to campus to learn about the important role
of geography in environmental science. I spoke with the students about
the kind of research I do and how we use it to monitor our natural
resources. We looked at a lot of pretty pictures of my field sites and
what those areas look like from space. We also looked at our home
watershed, the Cuyahoga River, in Google Earth and some other areas from
around the world that have experienced a lot of environmental change in
recent years. All of these examples provided a glimpse into how remote
sensing can expand our spatial, temporal and spectral scale of
observation.
