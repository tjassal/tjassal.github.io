We recently published a new data set to support an upcoming paper in the Journal of Biogeography. The goal of the project was to investigate forest regeneration patterns after a severe wildfire in the Andes Mountains and is in collaboration with Colorado State University and Universidad Austral de Chile. The data release includes information on wildfire burn severity and post-fire regeneration data collected in Tolhuaca National Park. To our knowledge this is the first study that connects field-measured data with satellite-derived burn severity in this corner of the world.
