I will present research on an approach to track post-fire changes in
plant functional type at the AGU Annual Fall Meeting in San Francisco
this week. My poster is part of the session entitled *Fire in the
Environment: Pyrogenic Organic Matter Cycling and Environmental Impacts
Across Watersheds*on Wednesday afternoon, December 11th in the Moscone
South poster hall. If youâ€™re AGU this year, please stop by.

Scale](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/611491)
