I will present research on fire-driven vegetation change in the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico at the US-IALE Annual Meeting in Fort Collins, CO. My talk is part of the session entitled Wildfire-driven Forest Conversion in Western North American Landscapes: Emerging Science and Implications for Resilience and Adaptation on Monday morning (11:15 am), April 8th, at the Fort Collins Hilton.
