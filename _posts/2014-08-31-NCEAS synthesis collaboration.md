This summer I had the privilege of attending the [Open Science for Synthesis (OSS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/OSS) training hosted by UC Santa Barbara’s [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). OSS is geared toward early career scientists who want to learn new software and technology skills needed for open, collaborative, and reproducible synthesis research. Forty-five scientists participated in the program: 23 attended NCEAS and 22 were hosted by the University of North Carolina’s [Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI)](https://renci.org/).

We received training from a great group of instructors through a mix of lectures, exercises, and hands-on work via collaborative group synthesis research projects. The diverse training covered a wide variety of information, spanning tools for hardcore computational biology to the social aspects of collaboration. We self-selected into small synthesis groups based on our proposals and research interests.

Our team is analyzing the impacts of the drought in California. As of mid-August over 99% of the state is classified in severe, extreme or exceptional drought.

We plan to analyze historical trends of drought in California, determine how much the carbon sink has been reduced by the current drought, and consider differences in resilience between ecosystems.

Our team is composed of nine scientists based in five different countries. My collaborators include:
Leah Bremer 	Stanford University, USA
Debora Drucker 	Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), Brazil
Vickn Hillis 	University of California, Davis, USA
Sparkle Malone 	US Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, USA
Antonio Jesus Perez-Luque 	University of Granada, Spain
Paul Selmants 	University of Hawaii, Manoa, USA
Mirela Tulbure 	University of New South Wales, Australia
Sara Varela 	Charles University, Czech Republic
