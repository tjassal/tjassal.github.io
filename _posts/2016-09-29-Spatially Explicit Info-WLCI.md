*“A map is the greatest of all epic poems.”* Gilbert H. Grosvenor, Editor of National Geographic (1903- 1954)

That’s a pretty strong quote to apply to these maps, but point taken Mr. Grosvenor. Elaborate spatial models have little utility if the information contained in them is not conveyed (in a map) to the natural resource managers charged with making decisions. Below are maps of forest cover [(Assal et al. 2015)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2150704X.2015.1072289) and  trend of forest canopy condition [(Assal et al. 2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112716000189) in the Little Mountain Ecosystem in southwest Wyoming and northwest Colorado prepared for our agency partners in the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative.
