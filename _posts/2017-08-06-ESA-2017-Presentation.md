I will present research of burn severity controls on post-fire Araucaria-Nothofagus regeneration in the Andean Cordillera at the [ESA annual meeting](https://www.esa.org/portland/) in Portland, OR. My talk is part of the session entitled: [(COS 153) – Communities: Spatial Patterns and Environmental Gradients](https://eco.confex.com/eco/2017/webprogram/Session13800.html) on Thursday afternoon (2:10 pm), August 10th, in the Oregon Convention Center, C120-121.
