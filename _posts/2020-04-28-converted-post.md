I recently contributed a chapter entitled *“Quaking Aspen: The Iconic and Dynamic Deciduous Tree of the Rocky Mountains”* to an AAG special volume . The goal of the essay was to describe aspen’s dynamic nature, challenges associated with stewardship, and current management-science efforts in the West to a broad audience. The open access volume, [Denver and the Rocky Mountain West](http://www.aag.org/cs/publications/special/the_rocky_mountain_west), is a compendium of short essays on topics of geographic interest about the region as opposed to traditional research articles. The book was published by the [American Association of Geographers](http://www.aag.org/) to commemorate the host region of the 2020 meeting. Unfortunately the conference was cancelled due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Rumor has it the meeting might return to Denver in 2023.
