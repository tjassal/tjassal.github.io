#2 Install and load packages (tidyverse and the nycflights13 packages)

# Section 2 - Manipulating and visualizing the dataframe
#4 Create a dataset (named 'march') using the filter() function in dplyr that contains all of the March flights.
march <- filter(flights, month == 3)
#4a How many flights took place in March?
count(march) # 28,834 flights took place in March.
#4b create a new dataset from march (name it 'march15') of the flights on March 15th
march15 <- filter(march, day == 15)
#4c How many flights took place on March 15?
count(march15) # 979 flights took place on March 15.
#5 Create a new dataset named 'Ides.of.March.flights' that represents flights from March 15th in one step.
Ides.of.March.flights <-filter(march, day == 15)
#6 Find all the flights that flew TO Cleveland (CLE code) and write to a new dataset named 'To.CLE'
To.CLE <- filter(flights, dest == "CLE")
#6a Filter this dataset to only include flights that flew during the winter months (Jan, Feb, March) and name it ‘To.CLE.Winter’
To.CLE.Winter <- filter(To.CLE, month < 4)
#6b Filter for flights that had an arrival delay of more than 2 hours and name it 'To.CLE.Winter.Delay'
To.CLE.Winter.Delay <- filter(To.CLE.Winter, arr_delay > 120)
#7a Create a new dataset named 'To.CLE.Winter.DelayB' that combines the two pervious steps into one step using a pipes.
To.CLE.Winter.DelayB <- To.CLE %>%
filter(month < 4) %>%
filter(arr_delay > 120)
#7b Create a dataset called 'To.CLE.Winter.DelayC' that builds on the previous pipe to only select the columns dep_time, carrier and arr_delay.
To.CLE.Winter.DelayC <- To.CLE %>%
filter(month < 4) %>%
filter(arr_delay > 120) %>%
select(dep_time, carrier, arr_delay)
#8 What was the mean delay by carrier for flights to Cleveland in the Winter? Write the answer to a new dataset called delay.by.carrier that contains the an average delay attribute.
delay.by.carrier <- To.CLE.Winter.DelayC %>%
group_by(carrier) %>%
